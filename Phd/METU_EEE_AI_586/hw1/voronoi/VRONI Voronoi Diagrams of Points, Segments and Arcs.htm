<H1>VRONI: Voronoi Diagrams of Points, Segments and Arcs in 2D</H1><BR><BR>
<P>In a recent <A 
href="http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00453/bibs/0027001/00270001.html">editorial</A>, 
Fortune wrote that "it is notoriously difficult to obtain a practical 
implementation of an abstractly described geometric algorithm". According to my 
personal experience this remark is particularly true for the implementation of 
Voronoi diagrams (VDs) of line segments. </P>
<P>This page shows Voronoi diagrams generated by my Voronoi code, VRONI. My code 
is reliable and efficient, and it can cope with any form of polygonal input 
data, be it clean or not. The design and implementation of VRONI is based on the 
following four corner stones: 
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00453/bibs/0027001/00270005.html">Sugihara 
  and Iri's topology-oriented approach</A>; 
  <LI>a very careful implementation of the numerical computations required; 
  <LI>an automatic relaxation of epsilon thresholds; and 
  <LI>a multi-level recovery process combined with desperate mode. </LI></UL>The 
algorithm was implemented in ANSI C, based on standard floating-point 
arithmetic. The concept of desperate mode has been borrowed from my 
triangulation code <A 
href="http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/triang/triang.html">FIST.</A> To 
my knowledge, VRONI is the first code for computing Voronoi diagrams of points 
and line segments which is both reliable and fast. Based on the Voronoi diagram, 
VRONI can also compute offset patterns or perform buffering. (See my <A 
href="http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/pocket_off/pocket.html">WWW pages 
on pocket machining</A> for an application of Voronoi-based offsetting.) Since 
VRONI computes a Voronoi diagram of points as its first stage, the code also 
supports the reliable computation of point Voronoi diagrams and of Delaunay 
triangulations. A recent extension can compute a maximum inscribed circle and 
can extract a (weighted) medial axis transformation (wMAT) from the Voronoi 
diagram. The code has been tested on polygonal and curvilinear datasets 
containing up to several hundred thousand points, segments and/or arcs; the 
largest polygon tested contains 2,124,304 vertices/segments. 
<P></P>
<P>As stated above, VRONI is able to compute (families of) offset curves that 
consist of straight-line segments and circular arcs. Of course, those offset 
curves may form the basis for a machining tool path. However, assembling those 
offset curves into a "decent" tool path is left to the user. Depending on what 
"decent" means this may be trivial or difficult. Since VRONI is used heavily in 
the CAD/CAM industry, I conclude that it is not horribly difficult to implement 
a machining algorithm on top of VRONI. In any case, please note that 
<UL>
  <LI>VRONI does not output G-code; 
  <LI>VRONI does not generate purely polygonal offsets (except in the interior 
  of a convex shape). </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Currently, the handling of circular arcs is restricted to user-defined or 
VRONI-computed polygonal approximations. Starting with Release 2.0 of VRONI, an 
approximate Voronoi diagram of points, line segments and circular arcs can be 
obtained from the true Voronoi diagram of the polygonal approximation of all 
arcs. The approximation scheme used to approximate circular arcs maintains 
tangent continuity, at an approximation tolerance set by the user. Also, genuine 
offset arcs can be generated during offsetting (rather than hundreds of line 
segments in the standard case of a polygonal approximation of an arc). 
Similarly, all other VD-based tools and extensions of VRONI (such as the 
computation of a weighted medial axis) are applicable to the approximate Voronoi 
diagram of circular arcs. </P>
<P>While this approach to handling Voronoi diagrams of circular arcs is 
obviously not theoretically correct, it seems to be perfectly fine for practical 
applications as long as the number of circular arcs is not excessively large. 
Since segments derived from a polygonal approximation of an arc are handled 
different than "normal" input segments, and due to the generally high processing 
speed of VRONI, the Voronoi diagram of several thousands of arcs can be computed 
at acceptable rates. Likely, the limiting factor when applying VRONI to tons of 
arcs will be main memory rather than speed. Support for true (rather than 
approximate) Voronoi diagrams of circular arcs might be added in the near 
future, but is not yet available. </P>
<P>The source code for VRONI is available for both academic and commercial use. 
Indeed, the code has been in wide-spread use, both commercially and within 
academic research projects. <A 
href="http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/email.html">Send me an email</A> and I 
will let you know the details of how you could use my code. However, in order to 
avoid any disappointment, let me warn you upfront that VRONI has not been 
released into the public domain! </P><BR><BR><STRONG>Related

<P>VRONI has been tested on several thousands of synthetic and real-world data 
sets. In particular, it was run on hundreds of GIS data sets, with 
longitude/latitude regarded as standard x,y-coordinates. The following images 
show Voronoi diagrams which were computed by means of VRONI. (Click on an image 
icon in order to see the full-size image. The full-size images have 800x800 
pixels.) Please note: all visible discontinuities are nothing but graphics 
artifacts - of course, the Voronoi diagram and the offsets are formed by 
continuous curves! </P>

      approximation of all arcs. Computing the approximate Voronoi diagram took 
      2,280 milliseconds on a 300MHz Sun Ultra 30. (You may also want to have a

      are genuine arcs.)
